### Features Testing
 
#### Minimal Design
- An important aspect of building this site is to be designed in a minimal way, which means fewer colours; and spaces are made everywhere to provide a comfortable site.
- Simple Color Palette:

#### Home Page
- Cover video has been replaced by an image -and changed in mockups as well- after noticing it's not matching the overall image colours of the home page.
- Header has been set to be fixed after testing to ease the site navigation journey.
 
#### Quotes
- Quotes are eye-catching and have different font size values depending on the screen size.
 
#### Card Slides
- Text on cards is shown by hovering the pointer over the image area for desktops and by clicking on the image for touch screen devices.
 
#### Article Brief
- Image fits the slice of the brief area, text ensured to be readable and hovering on the 'Full Article' button changes its colour and shows a 'right arrow' as a reference of the new page that will be open on button click.
 
#### Articles
- Cover image has been replaced by a smaller size image to improve the performance of the articles page after testing on Lighthouse.
 
#### Books
- All links on the book recommendations page have been tested and it opens the intended Goodreads profile in a new tab, aria-label has been added.  
 
#### Text Blocks
- Text blocks like articles, book recommendation, and about pages has been carefully formatted in the centre of the screen with justified text for better readability and helps the user to focus on the content.

### Interesting Bugs
- Below are some bugs which I found interesting to discover and resolve:
 
#### URLs on the manifest are not working
 
- Bug: URLs of Favicon and the index page in the site manifest file are not found by the client browser, it causes a console error of 404.
- Discovered by: testing by the dev tools.
- Action: it seemed as if GitHub pages access any link started by '/' as it is located in 'https://username.github.io/' directly and it ignores the repository name in the URL 'https://username.github.io/repo', I used the file absolute path to Favicon and index page.
- Result: problem solved and the browser is able now to access those files.

#### Button cannot be a descendent of an anchor tag
 
- Bug: using the anchor as a parent of the button in the 'Full Article' action, to get the button style and the anchor functionality.
- Discovered by: the W3C validator.
- Action: after research, I found that each one of these tags has a different purpose; the button used for interactive control of submitting or performing an action on the page itself, and the anchor for navigation, "...click to do both of those things at once" credit goes to [Quentin on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71442188/why-shouldnt-the-button-element-be-a-descendant-of-the-anchor-element), I removed the button tag and styled the anchor to look like a button.
- Result: it performs functionally as an anchor and provides the same look as the button.
 
#### Div cannot be a descendent of a paragraph tag
 
- Bug: in quotes, I added a div for credit inside the paragraph tag, to style it in a different format than the rest of the paragraph.
- Discovered by: the W3C validator.
- Action: I moved the div outside of the paragraph tags.
- Result: it has the same style right now and with no error raised in the W3C validator.
