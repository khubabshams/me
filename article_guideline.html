            <h2>
                7 Ways to sample minimalist living and living with less
            </h2>

            <!-- Article Text -->
            <p>
                From the moment we’re born, we’re told to pursue more. Advertisements from every television, radio,
                newspaper, magazine, billboard, and website scream to us on a daily basis that more is better. As a
                result, we work hard hours so that we can spend countless dollars purchasing the biggest homes, fanciest
                cars, trendiest fashions, most popular toys, and coolest technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we all know it’s not true. We all know, deep-down, that happiness can not be bought at a department
                store—more is not necessarily better. We’ve just been told the lie so many times we begin to believe it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what if, in reality, there is actually more joy in pursuing minimalist living and intentionally
                living with less?
            </p>
            <p>
                To that end, allow me to offer 7 areas of life where living with less can be sampled. They are designed
                to be picked one-by-one, risk-free. Conducting each experiment for 3-4 weeks will give a good feel for
                the practical benefits of minimalist living, but hey, it’s your experiment. You decide the length.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Clothes</h3>
            <p>
                According to statistics, we wear 20% of our clothes 80% of the time. That means that many of
                us have closets full of clothes that we no longer like or no longer fit us correctly. They are just
                taking up space. The simple exercise of going through your closet and removing all unused clothing
                leaves your closet lighter, your mornings less stressful, and your wardrobe full of things you love.
                Give your lighter wardrobe 30 days to work its magic… you’ll never miss those unused clothes.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Decorations</h3>
            <p>
                Many of the decorations in our homes hold no personal value to our lives. They just
                simply happened to match the color of the carpet or be on sale when we walked into the store.
                Unfortunately, they are distracting you and your guests from the decorations in your home that share
                your story and highlight your values. Take a moment to walk through your home with a discerning eye.
                Leave only the decorations that are the most meaningful and the most beautiful. Your home will begin to
                share your story in a beautiful way. And your old decorations will likely end up on sale at your next
                garage sale.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Toys</h3>
            <p>
                Too often, we fall into the line of thinking that says more is better… and so do our kids. We
                begin to purchase and collect far too many toys for our children. As a result, our children have no need
                to learn how to be creative, helpful, careful, or sharing. In that regard, fewer toys may benefit your
                kids in numerous ways. Although you may want to consult your children before you relocate their unused
                toys, there’s a pretty good chance that after only a few weeks the old, unused toys will be forgotten
                (except by whoever used to pick them all up).
            </p>
            <h3>4. Cooking Utensils</h3>
            <p>
                There never seems to be enough storage space in our kitchens. Yet most of our
                grandmothers cooked far more often, far more elaborately, and far better than many of us today… in much
                smaller kitchens. The truth is that when it comes to cooking, simple is almost always better. We need
                far less cooking utensils than we currently own. As a result, our drawers, cabinets, and countertops can
                be far better organized and useful if we simply owned less. To give this experiment a shot, check out
                this article from the New York Times: A No Frills Kitchen Still Cooks. Then, store all your unnecessary
                utensils in a plastic bin, put them away out of sight, and see if you just enjoy cooking a little bit
                more in your new, clutter-free environment.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Televisions</h3>
            <p>
                According to Nielsen, the average person watches 4 hours, 35 minutes of television each
                day. And the average American home now has more television sets than people. That threshold was crossed
                within the past two years. There are 2.73 TV sets in the typical home and 2.55 people. In the average
                American home, a television set is turned on for more than a third of the day — 8 hours, 14 minutes to
                be exact. We are literally sitting on the couch while life passes us by. Experiment with owning less
                televisions. As a result, you will watch less. And when you do, you will be more apt to do it together
                as a family.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Counter-tops</h3>
            <p>
                Clutter is a form of distraction. It pulls at our attention and redirects our thoughts
                – even for just an instant. Everything sitting out on your countertops competes for your attention.
                Unfortunately, we have become so accustomed to these distractions that we don’t even notice them
                anymore… until they are removed. Experiment, even for just 7 days, with keeping your countertops
                completely clear. Store things in drawers, cabinets, pantries, or temporary storage boxes. After one
                week, you’ll likely return some of it for the sake of convenience, but I’d bet my bottom dollar that you
                won’t return all of it.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Furniture</h3>
            <p>
                It may require some heavy-lifting, but if you’re up for the challenge, removing excess
                furniture from your rooms will immediately open up significant space and airflow in your home. The
                rarely-used pieces of furniture in your home are quickly recognizable and taking up more space than you
                realize. Oh sure, this experiment requires a place to store your furniture during the trial period, but
                it’s a quick and easy way to remove some of the largest clutter from your home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breaking it down like this makes minimalist living seem a lot more approachable. There is no speed
                requirement of how fast you have to pare down your belongings. No deadline to living with less.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start as comfortably as you’d like.
